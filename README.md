# Tabletop Coordination App

This is a fullstack webiste that allows user to search for Tabletop shops in an area. The website not only shows information about the shops but also how many users from the site are planning to go there. Users who are logged in can RSVP.

This was built as part of FreeCodeCamp's backend curriculum. I changed it from finding bars to finding Tabletop shops. I had to teach myself Angular for this project and learned how to incorporate an API with a database. I dislike how impersonal the site feels right now and I'm going to work on making it more sociably friendly once I find my Muse.

## User Stories

### FreeCodeCamp

* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

### Personal User Stories

* User Story: Changed bar to tabletop because I'm not 21. 
* User Story: I can view the Yelp article for the Yelp articles
* User Story: I can get the basic info just from this website alone.
